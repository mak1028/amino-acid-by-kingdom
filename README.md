# amino-acid-by-kingdom
This repository is for sql queries that used a public codon dataset. I used that dataset to convert the 
codons to their respective amino acids and get the average amino acid occurence by kindgom. The graph generated with this data is at 
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maria.khawaja.
